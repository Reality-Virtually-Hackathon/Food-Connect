# Food-Connect

Inspirtation: Factory farming is one of the biggest problems that faces the world today. Here are some key statistics though there are too many to list:

99% of the nearly 10 billion farm animals in the USA are factory farmed. That's almost 9.9 billion animals in the US alone.
The beaks of chickens, turkeys, and ducks are often removed in factory farms to reduce the excessive feather pecking and cannibalism seen among stressed, overcrowded birds.
Due to genetic manipulation, 90% of broiler chickens have trouble walking.
Dairy cows typically live to their third lactation before being culled. Naturally, a cow can live for 20 years.
Hog, chicken and cattle waste has polluted 35,000 miles of rivers in 22 states and contaminated groundwater in 17 states.
Egg-laying hens are sometimes starved for up to 14 days, exposed to changing light patterns and given no water in order to shock their bodies into molting.
Over 80% of US pigs have pneumonia upon slaughter.
What It Does:

Scan any grocery store item and AR content is displayed over it.
The AR content shows (1) ethical rating based on web sources (2) other people's reviews of the product
How We Built It:

Image recognition using Microsoft API
Swift iOS application
Apple ARKit
Challenges We Ran Into:

Importing the models into ARKit
Image recognition for specific brands
Accomplishments:

Creating something that will completely change the way people think about their food consumption
Putting an impressive prototype together in a short amount of time
What We Learned:

Planning is extremely important
Working as a unit is more important than any individual's skills. It's all about teamwork.
Hackathons create an awesome environment for condensed learning. And they're pretty fun.
What's Next for Food Karma:

Improve image recognition accuracy
Add other features to create a more rounded experience


API's Used:
